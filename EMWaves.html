<h1><font face=arial>EM waves</h1><!--Most important heading of this document.-->
<h3>EM waves or electromagnetic waves are those caused by photons of a electromagnetic field carrying electromagnetic radiant energy. This causes electromagnetic radiation.
There are 7 main types of EM waves. There are other types of these waves but we will learn
only these 7 types of waves.</h3><!--3rd most important heading.-->

    <h2>Terms of EM waves</h2>
<h4>There are terms to begin with learning about EM waves. They are as follows.
<ul>
<li>Frequency: The frequency of a wave is the number of times per second that the wave cycles. Frequency is commonly measured in Hertz.</li>
<li>Wavelength: The wavelength of a wave is the distance between two corresponding points on back-to-back cycles of a wave. 
Wavelength is usually represented in physics by the Greek letter lambda (Î»).</li>
</ul>
There! Now we can see the types of EM waves.</h4>

<h2>Types of EM waves</h2>
<fieldset>
<legend><h3>Radio waves</h3></legend>
<h4>Radio waves have a long wavelength but short frequency.
    They are used in radar, sonar, working of radioes, etc.
    They can pass through certain objects like ice but can get blocked by others like clouds and rain.</h4>

<legend><h3>Microwaves</h3></legend>
<h4>Microwaves are a little like radio waves but have shorter wavelength and higher frequency.
    They are obviously used in microwave ovens and also in Wi-Fi and phones. Interesting!
     They are blocked by metals and pass through paper,glass and plastics.</h4>

    <legend><h3>Infrared waves</h3> </legend>
<h4>Infrared waves have shorter wavelength than microwaves but have an even higher frequency.  
    There are many uses of infrared waves and they are included in infrared cameras, remote controls,etc. 
    They pass through dense reigons of gas and are blocked by certain substances like <style="color: wheat;" title="Plexiglas is a trade name for a cyanoacrylate sheet. This basically is a hard plastic, sheet. One of the more common usages for the clear variety is to replace glass in windows. It is available in many colors and also textures. It is also used a lot for signs."> plexiglass.</style>
<h4>We have some more information on these waves below:</h4>
    <img src="./images/INFRARED_WAVES.jpg" alt="Infrared waves">
<p>Yes,it's none other than a form of heat and it acts like light because it
    is near light,red light to be precise ("infra" means below so "infrared"
    means "Below red"). Of course there are 7 types of light as we will see. 
    Intresting that it travels as fast as light!</p>

    <fieldset><legend>  <h3>Visible light waves</h3></legend>
<h4>They are the only EM waves we can see.There are also many types of visible light including those
    found on the rainbow. These "colours" are the colours of light. The basic ones are red, yellow, blue and indigo
    and the mixed colours are orange, green and indigo. Oh, and also they have a shorter wavelength and higher frequency
    than infrared waves and there are natural and artificial uses of these waves but I can't go through 
    all of them. Suprsingly, different objects tend to let light pass impartially, partially or block the light.
    They are called transparent, transluscent or opaque objects respectively.</h4>

    <p>See the above LED bulb? White light is coming out.But for light,white isn't white but the 7 colours of the rainbow.
    Split the white light by putting a sheet of glass in front of it and you'll get a rainbow with all 7 colours!Volia!</p>

    <fieldset><legend> <h3>UV waves(a.k.a.Ultraviolet waves)</h3></legend>
<h4>Now visible light can prove harmfull sometimes but this pales in comparison to the sun's most common type of waves,
    UV waves. These harmfull waves cause sunburns and eye damage.And they come from UV lamps which contain a safe amount
    but our sun contains a harmfull dose of these waves. Fortunately, these waves can't pass through thick air or certain gases
    like ozone.There are also types of these waves and many uses of them. They have an extremely short wavelength and 
    an extremely high frequency.</h4>

    <fieldset><legend> <h3>X-ray waves</h3></legend>
<h4>They have an extremely short wavelength and higher frequency still and are even more harmfull.They are used in x-ray machines 
    in airports and hospitals where one or two of them are used. Three of them are horrifyingly horrible and can cause deadly damage.
    Even more can be fatal. A tough material like lead,tungsten or metal foam can block them fortunately.A thick layer of gas can also
    block them.</h4>

    <fieldset><legend> <h3>Gamma ray waves</h3></legend>
<h4>These are killer waves used carefully in nuclear power plants and atomic bombs. Their exetremely short wavelength and extremely high frequency
    make them very, very dangerous.One wave or hit can be fatal and only a thick vary layer of gas or thick metal shield can block them.</h4>
